<h1>The Best Movies According To SAM</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>House of Cards</h3>
<p>A seasonal movie about how to play by the game in politics.</p>
<h3>Money Heist</h3>
<p>A spanish professor plans the best heist in history with so much twist and turns. This movie focuses on letting people understand that family means more above everything and money is just paper but the barrier that exist between many in society.</p>
<h3>White House has fallen</h3>
<p>What i love about this movie is the Heroic character of a girl named Emily and Her Father John. The two single alone made me understand the true meaning of patriotism.</p>
