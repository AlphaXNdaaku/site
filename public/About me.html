<p>Abdul Mumin is my name and i hail from a small town in the Ashanti Region of Ghana called Ejura. Ejura is predominatly muslim, though its the town of asantes. Most of the Muslims in Ejura moved from the Northern part of Ghana to settle here and so their primary way of life is farming and trading. Unfortunately, Ejura only happens to be where i was born but i was not raised here.</p>
<p>Its worth noting that growing up things werent so perfect for my family because my mom and dad found their marriage and union in the middle of everything and that created division, misunderstanding and resentment which went great way to bring so much instability. As a kid, i realized i'm gonna have to be in charge of myself because coupled with the fact that most African parents, particularly people of the zongo, barely find time to have family conversations to get to know what diurection or career their kids intend to take. So subconsciously, i started parenting myself, holding myself responsible for my utterances, career goals and weighing for myself how my decisions can go a long way to profit me. So every direction i've taken throughout my life, every height i've reached has totally being my personal decisiom and with God's favor</p>
<p>As a human being you must understand that since we were created, then there must have been a manual through which we were created and also there automatically must be a manual by which we should opearte. It's obious that the world is made of somany human beigns with different backgrounds, different cultures and beleives and so i'd prefer to accept that thats not one thing so special about life. The most important thing on this earth is how humans break the barrier that exist amongs them so that they can peacefully coexist. To do this, all we need to master is "COMMUNICATION". The one thing that keeps us funtioning as a generation is our ability to exchange and so any human being who want's to be the best must know how to effectively communicate. It is also important to note that i take seriously one fact that in life, everything comes in pairs and so just as effective communication builds societies, ineffective and inproper communication destroys civilisations.</p>
<p>Every human must understand that their physical body is seperated from their mental state in theory. Through independent thinking and assesment of life, that's if you really do take self introspection serious, you'd come to the understanding that there are many attributes of mankind you'd need in great supplies depending on how great you want to be. Amongs those traits are: Humility, Respect, Faith, Ambition, Patience, Avoidance of quick judgement, Love as in TRUE love for people (unconditional love), constant self reflection, Personal honesty in admitting truth and reality, having low expectations in every aspect of outcomes and many more. The higher in amount you have all these traits the gretaer your greatness. The usual thing you hear peolple say is "i want to be great", "i want to be rich", but the question i'll ask all of this people is, be honest with yourself, given the level of your character, your level of intolerance, your level of feeling disconnected from your feelings, emotions, empathy, should you be magically given the gretness you pray for or wish for, do you trust you're ready for it, subconsciously, character-wise?? If your answer is NO, then it means you don't need anyone to lecture you on which aspect of life should be of great priority to you for now.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to be Rich and live a happy life and so i've taken the time to get all the tools that i need to be able to maintain my blessings whenever they come. So i have taken the time to gain all the things money can't buy and i'm literally halfway to Greatness. All i need is for money to knock on my door. I am the TRUE definition of a radically awakened person and so to enter my circle, you need to be equally or more awakened. My name is Abdul-Mumin and i'm going to be GREAT.</p>
